Biological aging refers to the actual age of your body's cells and tissues, which can be different from your chronological age. This research explored how eating fish and shellfish might influence this process. Scientists analyzed data from a large group of American adults and discovered that individuals who consumed fish and shellfish generally showed signs of slower biological aging. Specifically, regular fish consumption was associated with a younger "Phenotypic age," a measure that estimates your body's true age based on various health markers, and a reduced risk of "PhenoAge acceleration," which indicates faster-than-expected aging. The study suggests that the beneficial effects are primarily driven by fish consumption, rather than shellfish. Furthermore, the findings indicate that certain internal processes related to inflammation and the body's ability to fight off damage (antioxidant mechanisms) might explain some of this connection between fish intake and slower aging. This suggests that the nutrients in fish could be helping to keep our bodies biologically younger by influencing these key biological pathways.
