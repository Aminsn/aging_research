As living systems age, they accumulate small molecular defects that eventually lead to a decline in function. A recent study sheds light on a critical process contributing to this decline, particularly in yeast cells. It was found that as cells get older, certain genetic elements called extrachromosomal rDNA circles, or ERCs, build up. These ERCs interfere with the proper functioning of the nuclear pore complex, which acts like a gate controlling what goes in and out of the cell's nucleus, where genetic material is stored. This disruption causes messenger RNA (mRNA), which carries instructions for making proteins, to leave the nucleus before it's fully processed. When these incomplete instructions are used, the cell produces faulty proteins, especially those vital for ensuring chromosomes are correctly distributed during cell division. This leads to cells having an abnormal number of chromosomes, a condition known as aneuploidy, which is a significant factor in the aging process and can ultimately lead to cell death. Understanding this mechanism could be key to developing strategies to promote healthier aging.
