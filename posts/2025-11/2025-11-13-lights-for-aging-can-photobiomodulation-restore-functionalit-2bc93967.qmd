As we age, our brains undergo changes that can lead to less efficient thinking and memory, and an increase in inflammation. While a healthy lifestyle is often recommended, new research explores a fascinating non-invasive approach: light therapy. This method, called photobiomodulation, uses specific wavelengths of red and near-infrared light to target brain cells. The idea is that this light can energize the "powerhouses" of our cells, called mitochondria, leading to increased energy production. This boost in cellular activity is thought to slow down the wear and tear on brain cells, reduce inflammation, and even help improve the way different parts of the brain communicate. Essentially, this approach could potentially help restore more youthful patterns of brain activity, enhancing cognitive abilities like memory and attention, and potentially lowering the risk of age-related neurological conditions.
