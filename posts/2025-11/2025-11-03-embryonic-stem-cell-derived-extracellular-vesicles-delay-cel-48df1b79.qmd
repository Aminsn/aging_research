Our cells, like everything else, age. This aging process, known as cellular senescence, occurs when cells permanently stop dividing and can contribute to various age-related diseases. Imagine tiny packages released by cells, called extracellular vesicles (EVs), acting as messengers. Scientists have discovered that special EVs, originating from embryonic stem cells, possess remarkable properties that can help combat this cellular aging. These microscopic messengers have a protein called fibronectin on their surface, allowing them to attach to other cells. Once attached, they kickstart a chain of events inside the cell by binding to receptors called integrins, which then trigger the activation of FAK and AKT proteins. This ultimately leads to the inhibition of an enzyme called GSK3β and the stabilization of a protective molecule known as Nrf2. Nrf2 is like a cellular superhero, fighting against harmful "oxidative stress" caused by reactive oxygen species (unstable molecules that damage cells). By stabilizing Nrf2, these vesicles prevent the damage that would otherwise lead to cells becoming senescent. This exciting discovery sheds light on how these natural cellular components can extend the lifespan of cells and offers a promising new avenue for developing strategies to promote healthier aging.
