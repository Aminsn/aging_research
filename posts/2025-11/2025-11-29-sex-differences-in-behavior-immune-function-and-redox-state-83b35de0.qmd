It’s a well-known observation that in many species, including humans, females tend to live longer than males. But what are the underlying biological reasons for this difference? A recent study sheds light on this by investigating how sex influences various biological systems throughout life and ultimately impacts longevity.

The research, conducted on Swiss mice, revealed that significant biological differences between sexes emerge early in life and persist into old age. Specifically, female mice consistently demonstrated better performance in behavioral tests, exhibited more robust immune system function, and maintained a healthier "redox state" compared to their male counterparts.

What exactly is a "redox state"? It refers to the balance between beneficial antioxidants and harmful reactive molecules (often called free radicals) in the body. An imbalance, known as oxidative stress, can damage cells and contribute to aging and disease. The study found that females generally experienced lower oxidative stress.

These advantages in immune function and a more balanced redox state in females appear to be key factors contributing to their extended lifespan. The findings highlight the critical importance of considering sex as a fundamental biological variable in all research related to aging and health, as biological processes and their impact can differ significantly between males and females.
