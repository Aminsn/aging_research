Our bodies naturally undergo an aging process, where cells eventually stop dividing and accumulate. These "senescent cells" don't die off; instead, they remain active and release a mix of substances that can harm surrounding healthy cells and contribute to age-related problems. Scientists have identified a crucial protein called High Mobility Group Box 1 (HMGB1) that plays a central role in this process.

HMGB1 is unique because it is "redox-sensitive," meaning its activity changes based on the balance of chemical reactions within cells. While usually residing inside the cell's control center, the nucleus, where it helps maintain DNA, stress or aging can cause HMGB1 to move outside the cell. Once outside, particularly a specific form of it, HMGB1 acts like a messenger, spreading signals of aging and inflammation to other cells, even those far away through the bloodstream.

This protein contributes to the chronic, low-grade inflammation often seen in aging, a process sometimes called "inflammaging." It does this by triggering various immune responses and can even contribute to suppressing the immune system, further complicating the body's ability to clear damaged cells and fight disease. Understanding how HMGB1 works offers promising avenues for developing new strategies to combat aging and age-related diseases.
