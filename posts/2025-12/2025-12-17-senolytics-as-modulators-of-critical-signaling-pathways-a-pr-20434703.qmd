As we age, our brains can accumulate "zombie cells," also known as senescent cells. These cells have stopped dividing but remain in the body, releasing harmful substances that contribute to inflammation, oxidative stress, and the buildup of toxic proteins, all of which can worsen brain aging and lead to neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.

Scientists are exploring a promising new strategy using compounds called senolytics. These drugs are designed to specifically target and destroy these problematic "zombie cells." By clearing them out, senolytics help to reduce the harmful inflammation and oxidative stress in the brain.

Beyond just removing these cells, senolytics also work by influencing crucial communication networks within our cells, such as the mTOR, Nrf2-Keap1, AMPK, and Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) pathways. Modulating these pathways helps the brain in several ways: it enhances the cell's natural cleanup process (called autophagy) to remove damaged components and harmful accumulations, improves cellular metabolism, and boosts the brain's ability to repair itself and defend against damage from unstable molecules. Common examples of senolytics include dasatinib, fisetin, and quercetin. This combined approach of eliminating harmful cells and fine-tuning cellular pathways offers a novel and exciting avenue to address the fundamental causes of brain aging and neurodegenerative conditions.
