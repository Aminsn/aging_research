Scientists have recently made significant strides in understanding how human ovaries age by examining the activity of genes within individual cells and mapping their locations. Using advanced techniques that allow researchers to see which genes are active in specific cells and where those cells are situated within the ovarian tissue, a detailed map of aging ovaries was created from human samples ranging from puberty to older age. This comprehensive analysis revealed several key changes associated with aging. For instance, there were noticeable shifts in gene activity, indicating problems with how cells produce energy (a process called mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation) and with the development of reproductive structures. A particularly interesting discovery was a new type of blood vessel cell, termed CLDN5+ blood endothelial cells, which act as "semi-professional antigen-presenting cells." This means they can display signals to the immune system. Unlike many other cell types that lose their distinct features with age, these specific blood vessel cells showed increased immune-related activity and inflammation as the ovaries got older. The study also found an accumulation of antibody-producing cells in the outer regions of older ovaries. Furthermore, aging was shown to disrupt the overall communication networks between cells, specifically amplifying a signaling pathway (the DLK1:NOTCH3 axis) between supporting cells around egg follicles and these newly identified immune-active blood vessel cells. These findings offer a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular processes behind ovarian aging, potentially paving the way for new ways to diagnose and treat age-related reproductive issues.
