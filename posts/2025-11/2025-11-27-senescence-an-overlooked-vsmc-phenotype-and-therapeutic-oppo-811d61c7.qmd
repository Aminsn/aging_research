Our blood vessels contain specialized cells called vascular smooth muscle cells, or VSMCs, which are crucial for maintaining healthy blood flow. Traditionally, scientists have focused on how these cells change their identity in response to injury or disease. However, recent insights suggest that VSMCs can also enter a unique state called senescence. In this state, cells stop dividing but remain active, often releasing a mix of inflammatory molecules, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), that can harm surrounding tissues. This overlooked senescent VSMC phenotype plays a significant role in the development and progression of serious conditions like atherosclerosis, where arteries harden due to plaque buildup, and aortic aneurysms, which are dangerous bulges in the main artery. Recognizing senescence as a distinct and impactful state for VSMCs opens up exciting new avenues for treatment. Researchers are now exploring therapies, such as "senolytic drugs" that selectively remove these senescent cells, or "senomorphic agents" that modify their harmful secretions, to potentially prevent and treat a range of cardiovascular diseases.
