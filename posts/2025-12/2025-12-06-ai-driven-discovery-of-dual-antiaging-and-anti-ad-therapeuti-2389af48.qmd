Scientists have made a significant stride in the quest for treatments against aging and Alzheimer's disease by employing a novel artificial intelligence (AI) approach. This innovative method rapidly sifts through potential compounds and uncovers their precise mechanisms of action. Through this AI-powered screening, a well-known hormone, melatonin, emerged as a strong candidate.

Further investigations revealed that melatonin works by targeting a specific protein called p300, which is involved in modifying our genetic material. This interaction helps to reactivate a crucial biological clock mechanism in the brain, improving the body's ability to handle stress and protecting nerve cells. This discovery is particularly exciting because human studies have already shown that melatonin levels naturally decrease with age. Laboratory and animal experiments further demonstrated that melatonin can improve memory, reduce brain inflammation, and alleviate signs of cellular aging.

This research not only highlights melatonin's potential as a dual-purpose therapeutic but also establishes a new "AI-to-clinic" framework for developing drugs that can tackle complex age-related conditions like Alzheimer's disease.
