As we age, our bodies undergo various changes, and one area of increasing concern is the health of our liver. Recent research sheds light on a crucial protein that plays a significant role in protecting this vital organ. This protein, known as CEACAM1, is essential for maintaining healthy liver function.

Studies have shown that as we get older, our metabolism can change, leading to a decrease in the liver's ability to clear insulin from the bloodstream. This impaired insulin clearance is directly linked to a progressive reduction in CEACAM1 levels.

The consequence of this decline in CEACAM1 is a cascade of events that can harm the liver. High insulin levels, a condition called hyperinsulinemia, drive the accumulation of fat in the liver, leading to a condition known as hepatic steatosis. This is then followed by inflammation and, eventually, the development of liver scarring, or hepatic fibrosis.

Crucially, the research indicates that maintaining or restoring healthy levels of CEACAM1 can prevent these liver problems and may even contribute to a longer lifespan. This finding is supported by observations in humans, where lower CEACAM1 levels have been noted in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), with levels further decreasing as liver scarring progresses.

Essentially, this protein acts as a shield for the liver, helping it process insulin efficiently and preventing the inflammatory and scarring processes that can lead to serious liver disease. Understanding this mechanism opens new avenues for potential strategies to protect liver health as we age.
