Many factors contribute to skin aging, including environmental exposure and natural processes, which can lead to wrinkles, dryness, and uneven skin tone. Researchers recently investigated whether a natural supplement derived from porcine placenta could help combat these common signs of aging. In a study involving 90 participants between 35 and 60 years old who had dry skin and visible wrinkles around their eyes, individuals were given either the supplement or a placebo twice daily for 12 weeks. The study was conducted in a way that neither the participants nor the researchers knew who was receiving the active supplement, ensuring unbiased results. By the end of the 12 weeks, those who took the supplement showed noticeable improvements in several key areas. They experienced a significant reduction in the depth of their wrinkles, better skin hydration, increased skin elasticity, and a decrease in skin discoloration and redness. The skin also appeared to have a healthier glow. Importantly, no negative side effects were reported during the study, suggesting that this supplement could be a safe and effective way to support skin health as a complementary approach to existing skincare routines.
