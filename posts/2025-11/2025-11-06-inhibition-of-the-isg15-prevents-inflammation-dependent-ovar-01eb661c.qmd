As we age, our bodies experience various changes, and inflammation is a key factor contributing to many age-related conditions. In women, this can significantly impact ovarian function and fertility. Recent research has shed light on a specific protein, Interferon-stimulated gene 15, or ISG15, and its surprising role in this process.

Scientists observed that as ovaries age, the levels of ISG15 naturally increase. This increase was found to accelerate the aging of ovarian cells by promoting inflammation. Specifically, ISG15 appears to break down another protein called PSMD14, which normally helps to keep inflammation in check. When PSMD14 is degraded, it leads to an increase in inflammatory signals, ultimately harming ovarian health and reducing the reproductive lifespan.

However, the good news is that when ISG15 was reduced or "knocked down" in studies, it significantly improved ovarian function. This reduction helped to lessen inflammation, decrease harmful oxidative stress (an imbalance that can damage cells), and even protect the vital energy-producing structures within ovarian cells called mitochondria.

These findings suggest a promising new direction for addressing age-related infertility. By targeting and potentially inhibiting ISG15, it might be possible to reduce ovarian inflammation, preserve ovarian health, and extend female reproductive potential. This discovery offers a novel understanding of how female fertility declines with age and opens doors for developing new treatments.
