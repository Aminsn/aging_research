As we age, our bodies can experience a state of persistent, low-level inflammation, a process scientists call "inflammaging." This isn't the kind of inflammation you get from an injury, but rather a subtle, ongoing internal response that can contribute to various age-related health issues. Recent research highlights that this process has a unique impact on older women, particularly concerning their heart health.

One key factor is the decline in female hormones, specifically estrogens, during menopause. Estrogens typically have protective, anti-inflammatory effects, so their reduction can lead to increased inflammation and a higher risk of conditions like cardiovascular disease, which affects the heart and blood vessels. Women also tend to have stronger immune responses than men, which, while beneficial for fighting infections, can also make them more susceptible to this chronic inflammation.

Scientists have observed that postmenopausal women often show higher levels of certain inflammatory markers in their blood, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are indicators of inflammation and are linked to a greater risk of heart problems. Understanding these distinct ways inflammaging affects women is crucial for developing personalized strategies, like specific diets or medications, to reduce inflammation and promote healthier aging.
