Have you ever wondered why females often live longer than males in many species, including humans? Recent research sheds light on this intriguing question by exploring the differences between sexes in various biological functions throughout life. This study focused on how the body's internal balance systems, including the nervous and immune systems, and the "redox state" – a balance between beneficial and harmful molecules in the body – contribute to health and aging.

The findings indicate that significant biological differences between sexes emerge early in life and continue into old age. Specifically, females tend to show better overall health indicators, including more favorable behaviors, stronger immune responses, and a healthier redox state, meaning they experience less "oxidative stress" (damage caused by harmful molecules). This consistent advantage in these areas appears to be a key factor in their longer lifespans.

Researchers suggest that the enhanced longevity observed in females might be partly due to their robust innate immune system, which is the body's first line of defense, and their ability to maintain lower levels of oxidative stress. These insights highlight the critical importance of considering biological sex as a fundamental variable in future aging research, as it can profoundly influence health outcomes and lifespan.
