Our bodies undergo various changes as we age, but did you know that for women, the reproductive system shows the first signs of aging? Long before menopause, which is the definitive end of a woman's reproductive potential, the quality of eggs, also known as oocytes, begins to decline, affecting fertility. This decline isn't just about the ability to have children; it has far-reaching implications for overall health.

Emerging research highlights a strong connection between reproductive health and the risk of developing chronic diseases, which are long-lasting conditions like heart disease or diabetes. Reproductive disorders, such as infertility or common conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)—a hormonal imbalance that can cause irregular periods and other symptoms—are increasingly linked to higher risks of premature illness (morbidity) and death (mortality). Even natural phases in a woman's life, like puberty, pregnancy, and menopause, act as crucial turning points that shape health throughout her lifespan.

Traditionally, fertility has been viewed primarily in terms of procreation. However, understanding the biological mechanisms that link reproductive health to broader systemic health—the health of the body as a whole—is vital. By adopting an integrated, lifespan-based approach to reproductive health, we can better understand and address these connections, potentially leading to improved well-being and reduced risk of chronic diseases as we age.
