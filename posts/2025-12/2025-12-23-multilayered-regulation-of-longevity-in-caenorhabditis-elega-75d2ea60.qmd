Scientists have been exploring how to extend healthy lifespan, and a tiny worm called *Caenorhabditis elegans* has provided significant insights. Research shows that several strategies can prolong the life of these worms. These include reducing a key cellular communication pathway known as insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 signaling, which is a fundamental system within cells that responds to nutrient availability. Another effective method is dietary restriction, which involves reducing calorie intake without causing malnutrition. Mildly slowing down the energy production in the cell's powerhouses, the mitochondria, can also trigger protective responses that improve cellular health. Additionally, altering the germline, the cells responsible for reproduction, can sometimes redirect resources towards maintaining the body, leading to increased longevity. These different approaches work by enhancing the cell's ability to maintain the quality of its proteins and genetic instructions (RNA), adjust its energy use (metabolic remodeling), and resist various environmental challenges (stress resistance). Ultimately, a longer, healthier life in these worms arises from a complex and integrated regulation of how genes are expressed (transcriptional networks), how the body processes energy (metabolic networks), and how different parts of the body communicate with each other (inter-tissue signaling networks). Understanding these intricate mechanisms in *C. elegans* offers valuable clues for developing interventions to promote healthy aging in humans.
