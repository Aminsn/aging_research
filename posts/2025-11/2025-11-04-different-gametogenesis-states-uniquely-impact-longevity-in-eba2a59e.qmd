Have you ever wondered if giving up the ability to reproduce could actually help you live longer? In the world of tiny worms called *C. elegans*, scientists have explored this very question, and the answer turns out to be surprisingly complex. These worms, often used in labs to understand basic biology, typically have a trade-off between reproduction and lifespan: less reproduction can sometimes mean a longer life. This research looked at *C. elegans* worms that were sterile in different ways. Some worms were made "germline-less" by ablating germline stem cells, which are cells that can develop into eggs or sperm; these worms generally lived much longer. Another group was "feminized," producing only oocytes (egg cells) but no sperm; their lifespan extended only under specific temperature conditions. In contrast, "masculinized" worms, which only produced sperm but no oocytes, actually had significantly shorter lives. Interestingly, all these sterile worms, regardless of their lifespan, accumulated extra fat. However, the specific biological pathways controlling their longevity varied. For instance, a crucial gene called DAF-16/FOXO, which is a protein involved in stress resistance, metabolism, and aging, was essential for the extended lifespan seen in the germline-less and feminized worms, but it wasn't needed for the shortened lifespan of the masculinized worms. This work reveals that simply being unable to reproduce doesn't automatically grant a longer life. The specific ways in which the reproductive system is altered can lead to dramatically different outcomes for an organism's longevity, highlighting the intricate connections between reproduction, metabolism, and aging.
