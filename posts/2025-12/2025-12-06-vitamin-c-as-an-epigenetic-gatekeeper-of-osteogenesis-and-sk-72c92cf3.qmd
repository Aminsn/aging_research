For a long time, we’ve understood that a certain essential nutrient is vital for strong bones, mainly because it helps produce collagen, a key component of connective tissues. However, new studies are revealing an even more profound role for this ancient molecule: it acts as a critical "epigenetic regulator." Epigenetics refers to changes in how our genes are expressed—whether they are turned on or off—without altering the underlying DNA sequence itself. This nutrient serves as a necessary helper for enzymes that modify our DNA and the proteins that package it (called histones). By doing so, it controls which genes are active, a process fundamental for the proper development and differentiation of cells, including those responsible for building bone. This fresh perspective shows that its impact on bone health goes far beyond just making collagen or acting as an antioxidant. Given that many people still don’t get enough of this nutrient, and low levels are linked to a higher risk of bone conditions like osteoporosis and fractures, especially in older individuals, this discovery suggests it could be a safe, inexpensive, and scalable addition to existing treatments to improve bone resilience.
