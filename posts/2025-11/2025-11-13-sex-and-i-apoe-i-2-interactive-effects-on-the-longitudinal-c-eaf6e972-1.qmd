Our genes play a significant role in how our brains change as we get older. One such genetic factor is called APOE, which comes in different versions or "alleles." The APOE ε2 allele has often been thought to protect against cognitive decline, meaning it might help keep our thinking skills sharp as we age.

However, a recent study looking at older adults with risk factors for vascular disease found some surprising results. Contrary to the common belief, this research suggests that the APOE ε2 allele might actually be harmful to verbal memory in aging men. Verbal memory refers to our ability to recall spoken or written information, like remembering a shopping list or a conversation.

Furthermore, the study concluded that APOE ε2 does not provide a consistent protective effect on overall cognitive function as people age. These findings challenge previous assumptions and highlight the complex interplay between our genetics, sex, and how our brain's abilities evolve over time.
