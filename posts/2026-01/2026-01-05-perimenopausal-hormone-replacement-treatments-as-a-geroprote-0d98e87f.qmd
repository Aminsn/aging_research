As women approach menopause, their bodies undergo significant hormonal changes, particularly a decline in ovarian function. This transition, known as perimenopause, can initiate a cascade of biological changes that contribute to the aging process. Emerging research suggests that carefully considered hormone replacement treatments during this period could act as a protective measure against these age-related changes. These treatments are thought to influence the "hallmarks of aging," which are fundamental cellular and molecular processes that drive aging, such as genomic instability, cellular senescence, and altered intercellular communication. While these treatments have been used for various menopausal symptoms, their potential to actively slow down or mitigate aspects of aging is gaining recognition. The current understanding highlights a need for updated clinical guidance to better integrate this approach, emphasizing the importance of starting treatment within a specific window after the onset of menopause for eligible women. Future research is crucial to develop specific biological markers that can help personalize these treatments, ensuring they are most effective for each individual woman in promoting healthy longevity.
