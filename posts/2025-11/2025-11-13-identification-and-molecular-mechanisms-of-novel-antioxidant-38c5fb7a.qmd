Our bodies are constantly battling oxidative stress, a process where harmful molecules called free radicals can damage our cells and contribute to aging and disease. While synthetic antioxidants exist, there's a growing interest in finding natural alternatives with fewer side effects. This is where marine organisms, like the common Manila clam, come into play.

Scientists have discovered that by breaking down the proteins from Manila clams, they can isolate tiny protein fragments, known as peptides, that possess powerful antioxidant properties. These clam-derived peptides have shown remarkable abilities in laboratory settings. For instance, they significantly extended the lifespan of *Caenorhabditis elegans*, a small worm often used in research to study aging and health.

Beyond anti-aging effects, these peptides also demonstrated a protective effect on human liver cells, shielding them from damage induced by oxidative stress. They achieve this by reducing the levels of harmful reactive oxygen species and boosting the body's natural antioxidant defenses, including increasing levels of glutathione and stimulating protective enzymes.

To understand exactly how these beneficial peptides work, researchers employed advanced computer modeling techniques, including molecular simulations and quantum chemistry. These methods allowed them to visualize how the peptides interact with key proteins in the body that are involved in antioxidant responses, such as Keap1. This detailed understanding of their molecular mechanisms paves the way for potentially incorporating these natural compounds into functional foods or health supplements to combat oxidative stress and promote overall well-being.
