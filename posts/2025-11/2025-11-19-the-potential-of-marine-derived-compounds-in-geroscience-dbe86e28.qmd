As we age, our bodies undergo various changes that can lead to a decline in function and an increased risk of diseases like heart conditions, neurodegenerative disorders, and metabolic issues. Scientists are actively searching for new ways to promote healthy aging and extend our "healthspan" – the period of life spent in good health. One exciting area of research focuses on molecules found in marine environments. These compounds, sourced from oceans, possess unique structures and a wide range of beneficial properties, including their ability to act as antioxidants, reduce inflammation, and protect cells from damage. They work by targeting fundamental processes linked to aging, often referred to as "hallmarks of aging." For instance, they can help address issues like cellular senescence, where cells stop dividing but remain in the body, contributing to tissue damage. They can also combat genomic instability, which refers to damage to our genetic material, and improve impaired autophagy, the body's natural cellular clean-up process. While many of these marine-derived compounds have shown encouraging results in laboratory and preclinical studies, demonstrating their potential to prevent or treat age-related conditions, further research is crucial to translate these findings into effective therapies for human use.
