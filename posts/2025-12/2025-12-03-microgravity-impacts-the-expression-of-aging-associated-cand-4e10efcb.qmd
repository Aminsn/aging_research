The challenging environment of space can accelerate aging and negatively impact human health. NASA has identified several key hazards in space, with changes in gravity being one of them. This research aimed to understand how microgravity, specifically, influences gene activity in healthy individuals. Ten healthy men participated in a three-week study involving simulated microgravity through dry immersion. During this period, blood samples were collected, and T cells, a vital component of our immune system, were analyzed for changes in their gene expression. The study revealed that the activity of 30 genes within a crucial cellular network, known as the p53 network, was affected. This network plays a critical role in maintaining cell health and is closely associated with the aging process. Notably, some of the affected genes are involved in cellular senescence, a process where cells stop dividing and can contribute to aging. This study marks the first time that these specific cellular pathways in human T cells have been observed to be impacted by simulated weightlessness in living subjects. The findings suggest that even the relatively mild effects of simulated weightlessness are sufficient to activate these pathways. These molecular changes point towards a potential overlap between microgravity's effects and cellular aging, opening doors for the development of new drugs, potentially called "MG-senolytics," to combat the aging effects associated with space travel.
