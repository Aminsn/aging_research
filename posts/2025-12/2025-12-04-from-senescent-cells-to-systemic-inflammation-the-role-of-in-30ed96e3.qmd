title: "From Senescent Cells To Systemic Inflammation: The Role Of Inflammaging In Age-Related Diseases And Kidney Dysfunction"
description: Aging is characterized by a chronic, low-grade inflammatory state, termed inflammaging, which is driven by the accumulation of senescent cells and their inflammatory secretions, contributing to various age-related diseases, including kidney dysfunction.

As we age, our bodies undergo a subtle but significant shift, developing a persistent, low-level inflammation known as "inflammaging." This isn't the acute inflammation you experience with an injury, but rather a chronic state that quietly contributes to many age-related health problems. A key player in this process is the accumulation of "senescent cells"—cells that have stopped dividing due to stress or damage but remain in the body, refusing to die off. These senescent cells release a cocktail of inflammatory molecules, collectively called the "senescence-associated secretory phenotype" (SASP), which fuels the chronic inflammation throughout the body. This ongoing inflammation, combined with a decline in immune function (immunosenescence), creates a harmful environment that impairs tissue function and accelerates the development of diseases like chronic kidney disease. The paper highlights that factors such as issues with cellular energy production (mitochondrial dysfunction), shortening protective caps on chromosomes (telomere attrition), problems with cellular waste removal (impaired autophagy), and imbalances in gut bacteria (gut microbiota dysbiosis) all contribute to inflammaging. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial because it opens doors for new strategies to promote healthier aging. Researchers are exploring therapies like "senolytics" (drugs that selectively kill senescent cells) and "senomorphics" (drugs that alter the harmful secretions of senescent cells), as well as immunomodulation and lifestyle changes, to reduce the burden of these problematic cells and dampen inflammaging, ultimately aiming to extend our healthy years.
