As ovaries age, they experience increased cellular stress, which can contribute to difficulties in getting pregnant. This stress is often linked to an imbalance of harmful molecules called free radicals, a condition known as oxidative stress. Our bodies have a natural defense system against this, spearheaded by a crucial protein called NRF2. Think of NRF2 as a master switch that turns on genes responsible for protecting cells from damage.

Recent research has uncovered that a compound found naturally in plants, called trigonelline, can activate this NRF2 pathway. When activated, trigonelline helps to "wake up" the dormant, or resting, egg cells within the ovaries. These dormant egg cells, also known as primordial follicles, are essentially the reserve supply of eggs. By activating them, the study observed an improvement in the quality of eggs and a higher chance of successful pregnancies in older mice.

The mechanism behind this is quite fascinating: trigonelline prompts NRF2 to move into the cell's nucleus, where it then boosts the production of certain protective genes, including one that leads to increased levels of a growth factor called EGF. This EGF then triggers a cascade of events within the egg cell, ultimately leading to the activation and development of these previously dormant follicles. These findings suggest a promising new avenue for developing treatments to address age-related infertility.
