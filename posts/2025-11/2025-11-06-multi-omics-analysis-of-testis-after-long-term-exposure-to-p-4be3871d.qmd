Tiny plastic particles, known as nanoplastics, are becoming a significant environmental concern, and new research sheds light on their impact on male reproductive health. Scientists investigated the effects of prolonged exposure to polystyrene nanoplastics on the testes of mice, examining both young and older animals.

The findings revealed that these microscopic plastic particles caused considerable harm to the structure and function of the testes in both age groups. This damage resulted in a significant loss of cells crucial for sperm production, the deterioration of the delicate internal structures of the testes, and a decrease in overall sperm quality. Interestingly, younger mice exhibited signs of premature testicular aging, meaning their reproductive organs showed characteristics of being older than their chronological age. In contrast, older mice experienced even more severe testicular damage from the nanoplastics.

To understand how this damage occurs, the researchers used advanced techniques called "multi-omics analyses," which look at a vast array of biological molecules like proteins (proteomics) and metabolic byproducts (metabolomics). They discovered that in young mice, the nanoplastics mainly interfered with RNA metabolism—the process by which genetic information is translated into functional proteins. In older mice, however, the damage was more extensive, affecting the breakdown of DNA and disrupting the metabolism of collagen and the extracellular matrix, which are vital for maintaining tissue structure and integrity.

Additionally, the study suggested that nanoplastics might contribute to reduced testosterone production in younger mice by downregulating a specific protein called scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI). This comprehensive research underscores that exposure to these pervasive plastic particles poses risks to male fertility, with the severity of damage depending on both age and duration of exposure. Protecting processes like RNA metabolism and testosterone synthesis could be crucial for preserving reproductive capacity in young males exposed to nanoplastics.
