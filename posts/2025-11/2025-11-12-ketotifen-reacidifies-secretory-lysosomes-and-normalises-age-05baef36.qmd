title: "Ketotifen Reacidifies Secretory Lysosomes And Normalises Ageing Phenotypes In Mast Cells"
description: A recent study discovered that a common medication called ketotifen can restore the proper acidic environment within specialized compartments of immune cells called mast cells, thereby reversing certain age-related changes in these cells.

Our immune cells, particularly mast cells, play a critical role in defending our bodies and are often involved in allergic reactions. As we age, these important cells undergo changes, and a key observation is that their internal storage and release compartments, known as secretory lysosomes, lose their essential acidity. This acidic environment is crucial for these compartments to function correctly, enabling them to store and release their contents effectively. Researchers have now found that ketotifen, a medication already in use, can restore this vital acidity within aging mast cells. This restoration leads to noticeable improvements, such as the enlargement of these storage compartments and a reduction in the overall increase of mast cells that typically occurs later in life. The mechanism behind ketotifen's action involves boosting the activity of specialized pumps (V-ATPase) that actively acidify these compartments and enhancing a process called endocytosis, where cells take in materials from their surroundings. These findings suggest that targeting the acidity of these cellular compartments could be a promising new approach to counteract age-related inflammation, a condition often referred to as "inflammaging," which contributes to various age-related health issues.
