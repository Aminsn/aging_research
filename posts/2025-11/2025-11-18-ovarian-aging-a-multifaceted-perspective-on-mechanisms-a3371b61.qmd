Ovarian aging refers to the natural decline in a woman's reproductive capacity as she gets older, involving a decrease in both the number and quality of eggs, or oocytes, stored in the ovaries, eventually leading to menopause. This process is not simple; it is influenced by many interacting factors. A key finding is that problems with mitochondria play a central role. Mitochondria are often called the "powerhouses" of our cells because they generate the energy needed for cells to function properly. When mitochondria in ovarian cells do not work efficiently, it significantly impacts the health and viability of eggs. Beyond mitochondrial issues, several other mechanisms contribute to ovarian aging. Oxidative stress is one such factor, occurring when there is an imbalance between harmful molecules called free radicals and the body's ability to neutralize them, which can damage ovarian cells and their genetic material. Genetic factors also play a role, meaning some individuals may be predisposed to earlier ovarian aging. Furthermore, changes in hormone levels, chronic inflammation within the ovary, and alterations in the ovarian microenvironment—the surrounding tissues and cells that support egg development—all contribute to this complex aging process. Understanding these interconnected mechanisms is crucial for developing strategies to maintain ovarian function and potentially extend a woman's reproductive lifespan.
