As we age, our bodies accumulate damage to our genetic blueprint, known as the genome. This damage can lead to errors during cell division and gene activation, ultimately contributing to the aging process and increasing the risk of diseases like cancer. Our cells have built-in systems, called DNA damage response mechanisms, to fix these errors and maintain the integrity of our genetic material. However, these systems can become less efficient over time. Researchers are exploring ways to bolster these natural defenses. One approach involves finding ways to prevent DNA damage in the first place, while another focuses on enhancing the cell's ability to repair existing damage. Additionally, strategies that target how cells respond to damage, for example, by removing cells that have stopped dividing but are still active (senescent cells), show promise. By understanding and manipulating these fundamental cellular processes, it may be possible to reduce the burden of age-related diseases and promote a longer, healthier life.
