As we age, the tiny powerhouses within our cells, called mitochondria, can start to falter. These essential components are responsible for generating most of the energy our bodies need. However, with time, their ability to produce energy efficiently can decline, leading to an increase in harmful byproducts, often referred to as damaging molecules. This decline also involves changes in their genetic material and how they maintain their health and function, including their ability to fuse, divide, and remove damaged parts. These age-related changes in mitochondria have a profound impact on our cardiovascular system. They contribute to issues like the inner lining of blood vessels not working properly, blood vessels becoming less flexible, and structural changes in the heart, such as the thickening of its main pumping chamber and difficulty for the heart to relax and fill with blood. Ultimately, these problems increase the risk of various heart and blood vessel conditions. Understanding these intricate connections between aging mitochondria and cardiovascular health is crucial, as it opens doors for developing new strategies, such as targeted therapies and lifestyle interventions, to maintain mitochondrial health and protect our hearts as we get older.
