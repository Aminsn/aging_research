Aging science moves fast. Every day, new papers, datasets, interventions, and theories appear across journals, preprint servers, and labs — but most of us don’t have hours to scan them all. **GeroFeed** was created to solve exactly that problem.

### TL;DR
This site fetches the newest work on aging and generates AI-written summaries so you can discover relevant research faster.
:::

## What this site does

1. **Fetches the newest work** on aging, longevity, and geroscience from PubMed.
2. **Groups findings** into useful themes (e.g., pathways & hallmarks, biomarkers & clocks, therapeutics, methods, lifestyle levers).
3. **Generates an AI-written summary/blog-style post** for each item to surface the core claim, model/population, and why it matters.
4. **Keeps the feed fresh** so you always see what’s emerging right now.

## Who it’s for

- **Researchers & scientists** who want a daily pulse on aging biology.  
- **Clinicians & translational folks** tracking interventions, biomarkers, and geriatric outcomes.  
- **Longevity enthusiasts / general public** seeking science-based updates instead of hype (blog posts are written to be approachable for the general public).
- **Idea hunters**, grant writers, PhD students, biotech founders, who need a steady stream of signals.

## How the AI is used

- AI helps **summarize** and **rephrase** research in a more readable way.  
- It aims to preserve the **main finding**, **model/population**, **methods**, and **implications**.  
- For anything you plan to **cite, build on, or critique**, please click through to the original source.

### Important
This is a **discovery and triage tool**, not a peer reviewer. Inclusion ≠ endorsement.
:::

## Transparency & limits

- Not every study here is equally strong.  
- AI-written summaries can miss caveats or over-generalize.  
- You should still read the full paper if you work in that area.  

If you spot something off, want your work included, or have feature ideas, please reach out, feedback from people actually doing aging research is the fastest way to improve this.
