Our bodies contain special cells called mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) that have the remarkable ability to repair and regenerate tissues. However, these cells can undergo a process called senescence, essentially cellular aging, where they stop dividing and can even release substances that harm surrounding healthy cells. This aging limits their potential for use in medical treatments.

A recent study explored how a natural compound, Ginsenoside Rh2, might combat this cellular aging. Researchers found that this compound can effectively inhibit the senescence of MSCs. It does this by positively influencing two crucial components within cells: mitochondria and lysosomes.

Mitochondria are often called the "powerhouses" of the cell because they generate the energy needed for cell function. Lysosomes act as the cell's "recycling centers," breaking down waste products and old cell parts. The study revealed that Ginsenoside Rh2 works by activating a protein called Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). This activation helps the cells remove damaged mitochondria through a process called mitophagy and also reduces the release of inflammatory signals that contribute to aging. Furthermore, Rh2 improves the stability of lysosomes and reduces the secretion of tiny communication packages called exosomes, which can spread aging signals to other cells.

These findings are significant because they suggest a new way to keep MSCs healthy and functional for longer, potentially enhancing their effectiveness in various clinical applications, such as regenerative medicine.
