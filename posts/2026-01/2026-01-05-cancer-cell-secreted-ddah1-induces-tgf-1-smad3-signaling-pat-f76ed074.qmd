title: "Cancer-Cell-Secreted Ddah1 Induces TGF-Β1/Smad3 Signaling Pathway To Promote Fibrosis And Aging In Lung"
description: Cancer cells release a protein called DDAH1, which causes an increase in citrulline, subsequently activating the TGF-β1/Smad3 signaling pathway to accelerate lung scarring and aging.

Our lungs naturally age, becoming more susceptible to various diseases, including cancer. Recent research sheds light on how cancer cells might actively contribute to this aging process in the lungs. It turns out that cancer cells secrete a specific protein, which then leads to a buildup of a molecule called citrulline in the lung tissue. This increased citrulline acts as a signal, triggering a particular communication pathway within lung cells responsible for maintaining tissue structure. When this pathway is activated, it promotes the formation of scar tissue in the lungs, a process known as fibrosis, and generally speeds up lung aging. Importantly, the study also found that by blocking the action of this cancer-secreted protein, it was possible to reduce lung scarring and alleviate the signs of aging in the lungs. This discovery opens up new possibilities for understanding and potentially treating the interplay between cancer and lung aging, offering a novel target for therapeutic interventions.
