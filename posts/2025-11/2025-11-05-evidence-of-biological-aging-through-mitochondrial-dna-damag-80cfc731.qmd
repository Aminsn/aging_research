title: "Evidence of biological aging through mitochondrial DNA damage and dysregulation of mitophagy-related genes in veterans with delayed sulfur mustard toxicity"
description: Exposure to sulfur mustard causes long-lasting damage to the powerhouses of cells, called mitochondria, and disrupts their ability to clean up faulty components, leading to accelerated biological aging in affected individuals.

Our bodies are complex machines, and like any machine, they can show signs of wear and tear over time—a process we call aging. But sometimes, certain environmental exposures can speed up this process, leading to what's known as "accelerated biological aging." One such exposure, sulfur mustard, a chemical warfare agent, has been linked to severe long-term health problems.

A recent study sheds light on a key mechanism behind this accelerated aging: damage to our cells' power generators, the mitochondria. Mitochondria are vital organelles responsible for producing energy for our cells, and they contain their own DNA, called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). This mtDNA is particularly vulnerable to damage.

Researchers examined veterans who had been exposed to sulfur mustard many years ago. They found that these individuals, especially those with more severe exposure, showed significantly higher levels of damage to their mitochondrial DNA.

Beyond just damage, the study also revealed issues with how the body handles these damaged mitochondria. Our cells have a crucial process called "mitophagy" – essentially, a cellular clean-up crew that removes old or damaged mitochondria to maintain cellular health. The study observed increased activity in genes related to this clean-up process in the exposed veterans, suggesting that while the body is trying to respond to the damage, the system is dysregulated.

These findings strongly indicate that sulfur mustard exposure leads to persistent mitochondrial dysfunction. This occurs through a combination of cumulative mitochondrial DNA damage and problems with the cellular machinery responsible for recycling and managing these vital energy producers. This impairment of mitochondria appears to be a central factor driving the accelerated aging observed in individuals affected by sulfur mustard.
