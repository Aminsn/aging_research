Our bodies undergo many changes as we age, and one of the most significant impacts is on our heart and blood vessels. Scientists have been uncovering the intricate ways aging affects our cardiovascular system, leading to conditions such as heart failure and hardened arteries. At the core of this process are several cellular and molecular changes. For instance, our genetic material can become less stable over time, and the protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes, called telomeres, can shorten. Cells also struggle to maintain a healthy balance of proteins, a process known as proteostasis, and some cells can enter a state called senescence, where they stop dividing but remain active, potentially releasing harmful substances. Chronic low-grade inflammation, issues with the powerhouses of our cells (mitochondria), and disturbances in how our body uses energy are also key culprits. These changes collectively contribute to the deterioration of the cardiovascular system. However, understanding these fundamental mechanisms opens doors for exciting new treatments. Researchers are exploring various strategies, including therapies that target metabolism, agents that clear senescent cells (senolytics), antioxidants to combat damage, and even approaches using stem cell-derived messengers, to help mitigate the effects of aging on our hearts.
