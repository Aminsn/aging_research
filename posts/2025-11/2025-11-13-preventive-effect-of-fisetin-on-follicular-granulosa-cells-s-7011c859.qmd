Scientists have recently uncovered how a natural compound can help combat the aging process in vital reproductive cells. These cells, called granulosa cells, are crucial for healthy egg development, and their decline due to aging is a major factor in reduced fertility, particularly in older hens. This research shows that the compound works by tackling cellular stress, which is like rust for our cells, and by improving the cells' ability to divide and function properly. It achieves this by boosting the body's natural defense systems against damage and by activating pathways involved in cell growth and repair. Essentially, this compound helps these important reproductive cells stay younger and healthier for longer, suggesting a potential strategy to maintain reproductive health and improve egg production as organisms age.
