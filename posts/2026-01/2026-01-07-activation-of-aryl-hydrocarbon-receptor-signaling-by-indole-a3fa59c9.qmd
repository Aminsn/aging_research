As we age, our bodies often experience a state called "inflammaging," which is a chronic, low-grade inflammation that contributes to many age-related health problems. This process can be exacerbated by an impaired gut barrier and a dysregulated immune system in the intestines, known as gut mucosal immunity.

Recent research has shed light on how certain beneficial gut bacteria, known as probiotics, might help combat inflammaging. One such probiotic, *Bacillus velezensis* DS2, produces a special compound called indole-3-lactic acid (ILA).

This study found that ILA acts as a key player by activating a protein called the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). Think of AhR as a sensor in our cells that responds to certain molecules, influencing various biological processes, including immune responses. When ILA activates AhR, it triggers a cascade of beneficial effects.

Specifically, this activation leads to an increase in immune cells called type 3 innate lymphoid cells (ILC3s) that produce a protective signaling molecule called IL-22. IL-22 is crucial for maintaining the strength and health of the gut lining, which acts as a barrier to prevent harmful substances from entering the bloodstream.

In aged mice, supplementing with *Bacillus velezensis* DS2, or even just ILA, improved the integrity of their gut barrier and reduced widespread inflammation throughout their bodies. This ultimately helped to lessen the effects of inflammaging.

These findings suggest that targeting the gut-immune connection with specific probiotics or their beneficial byproducts like ILA could be a promising new strategy to support healthy aging and combat age-related immune decline.
